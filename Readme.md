Duplicate 2 Window for Firefox 4
===
Open new windows with the current URL!

This addon overrides the CTRL-N hotkey and opens the new windows with the current URL.
Forked from Restartless Restart, thanks to Erik Vold!

The main audience of this extension is the (ex-)IE users who need this new-window behaviour.
